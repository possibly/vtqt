#vtqt

A web server that so far serves a few static files, but will eventually enable saving of card setups for quick play and multi-user sessions with hiding of cards from other players.

A web app that allows one to upload a csv that defines cards, sort the csv into piles, add players who have various counters and piles, and move cards from one pile to another.

The idea is to simulate just enough of card physics (face up/down, drawing, shuffling, moving, passing between players, etc.) to make it extremely simple to play a huge variety of card games given a well-defined csv of the cards.
